        My technical skillset is grounded in all areas existing within the
        domain of the browser. I take immense enjoyment in leveraging React to
        write lean, reusable components and scalable JavaScript code that serves
        the purpose of solving complex user stories, further fueled by a
        relentless commitment to deliver exceptional users interfaces that are
        semantically structured, translate seamlessly across multiple devices
        and browsers, and are accessible to all users.
